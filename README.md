# HTML & CSS

## Introduction
This repository contains practice exercises and a YouTube clone developed as part of an [HTML & CSS course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=8758s). The main goal of this project was to practice and demonstrate the skills learned during the course, including HTML structure, CSS styling, and responsive design.

## Features
- **HTML5**: Use of different HTML elements for better structure and readability.
- **CSS3**: Modern CSS techniques for layout and styling.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes.
